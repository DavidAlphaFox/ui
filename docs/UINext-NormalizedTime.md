# NormalizedTime
> [UI.Next Documentation](UINext.md) ▸ [API Reference](UINext-API.md) ▸ [Animation](UINext-Animation.md) ▸ **NormalizedTime**

Normalized time typically ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, though can
temporarily take values outside of this range.  It is used heavily
in animation.  Implemented as a type alias:

```fsharp
namespace WebSharper.UI.Next

type NormalizedTime = double
```
